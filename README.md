## Problem Statement

This **Mobile Sales Dashboard** is a **Power BI** report designed to analyze mobile phone sales performance for retailers and brands. It includes **data transformation**, **modeling**, **DAX calculations**, and **visualization** to track key metrics. It tracks **sales trends**, **regional performance**, **customer behavior**, and **payment insights**, with **MTD** and **YoY** comparisons. The dashboard helps optimize marketing, pricing, and promotions to drive better sales and business decisions.

## Steps followed 

- **Step 1 : Data Loading**
  
    Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a excel file.
  
- **Step 2 : Data Transforming**
  
   Open power query editor & using the ETL tools for Data cleaning and processing.
  
- **Step 3 : Data Cleaning and Processing**

  It was observed that some columns needed modifications. Following modifications were done:
     
  - **Day, Month, and Year columns**
    
    These terms were allocated different column each but the analysis demanded them to be combined and hence it was done using *merge column* option.

   - **Day Name column**

     This column had some mix data form, which could be processed using *Replace Values* or even *Date* option but it would just show the *Day Name* for only those dates which are present in the data.
     But for analysis each and every day from those 4 years were needed. So to deal with it Custome calender table was made.

    - **Custome Calender Table**
  
      It was made so that we can get the Day Name for each and every date present in that particular year.
      
      Following formula was used to get that info and later on it was converted into the column:
  
          = List.Dates(#date(2021,1,1),1461,#duration(1,0,0,0))

 - **Step 4 : Data Modeling**

   i.e Relationship was created between two tables.

- **Step 5 : Doing required DAX calculations**
  
   New Measure where added:
            
   **(a) Total_quantity**
		
		        Total_quantity = SUM(Sales_Data[units sold])
			 
   **(b) Total_sales** 
		   
		        Total_sales = SUMX(Sales_Data,Sales_Data[Units sold]*Sales_Data[Price Per Unit])
         
   **(c) Total_transactions**
		
		       Transactions = COUNTROWS(sales_Data)
			 
   **(d) Average_Price**

            Average_Price = AVERAGE(Sales_Data[Price Per Unit])

 - **Step 6 : Dash Board Creation**
   
   Dashboard was created using different charts, tables, cards, slicers, map, text box to get the insight regarding various terms.
   
  
  - **Step 7 : Month To Day (MTD) Calculation and Dashboard Creation**
    
    MTD for total sales was calculated using formula:
	    
		 MTD = TOTALMTD([Total_Sales],Custome_Calender[Date].[Date])
  
  
  - **Step 8 : Same Period Last Year Calculation and Dashboard Creation**
      
    To compare last year sales with this year using formula:
	  
	     Same Period Last Year = CALCULATE([Total_Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Custome_Calander[Date].[Date]))
